# Comprehensive Specification for Project 103: New Red Home Page for Sashanator

## 1. Implementation Requirements

### 1.1 Functional Requirements
- **Red Background**: 
  - The home page must have a solid red background color (#FF0000).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: When the page is loaded, the background color must be red.
  
- **Prominent Text**: 
  - The text "Sashanator!" must be displayed prominently.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: The text must be centered, bold, and have a minimum font size of 48px.

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: 
  - The home page should load within 2 seconds under normal network conditions.
  
- **Security**: 
  - Ensure no sensitive data is exposed and validate all inputs (even though none are required for this page).
  
- **Scalability**: 
  - The page should be capable of handling up to 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
  
- **Accessibility**: 
  - The text must have a sufficient color contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1) to ensure readability.

### 1.3 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Home page has a red background.
- [ ] The text "Sashanator!" is displayed prominently and styled correctly.
- [ ] Page loads within 2 seconds under normal conditions.
- [ ] No sensitive data is exposed.
- [ ] Compliance with accessibility standards met.
- [ ] Minimum 80% test coverage achieved.

## 2. Technical Specifications

### 2.1 File Structure and Modules
- [CREATE NEW] `main.py` - FastAPI application entry point.
- [CREATE NEW] `templates/home.html` - HTML file for the new home page.
- [MODIFY EXISTING] `requirements.txt` - Ensure FastAPI is listed as a dependency.

### 2.2 Class/Function Signatures and Interfaces
- **main.py**: 
  - `app = FastAPI()`
  - Route definition: 
    ```python
    @app.get("/home")
    async def read_home():
        return templates.TemplateResponse("home.html", {})
    ```

### 2.3 API Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: 
  - `GET /home`
- **Response**: 
  - Returns HTML content with the specified styles.
- **Status Codes**: 
  - 200 OK for successful page load.

### 2.4 Data Models and Schemas
- **Data Models**: 
  - No data models required for this static page.

---

## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Actionable Steps
1. **Create `main.py`**:
   - Define the FastAPI application and create the route for the home page.
   - **Dependencies**: None.
   - **Testing Requirement**: Ensure the route is accessible.

2. **Create `templates/home.html`**:
   - Design the home page with a red background and the text "Sashanator!" centered and bold.
   - **Dependencies**: Requires `main.py` to be implemented first.
   - **Testing Requirement**: Verify the page appearance and styling.

3. **Test the home page**:
   - Load the page and check if it meets the specified design and performance criteria.
   - **Dependencies**: Completion of steps 1 and 2.

## 4. Code Guidelines

### 4.1 Specific Code Patterns
- Follow PEP 8 coding standards:
  - Use snake_case for function/variable names.
  - Use PascalCase for class names.
  - Implement type hints for function parameters and return types.
  - Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions/classes.
  - Maintain a line limit of 100 characters.

### 4.2 Libraries/Frameworks
- Use FastAPI (already part of the existing stack).
- No additional libraries are required for this static page.

### 4.3 Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs (though none are applicable for this page).
- Ensure no sensitive data is hardcoded or exposed.

### 4.4 Error Handling Requirements
- Implement error handling for potential issues:
  - Return HTTP 500 for server errors.
  - Return HTTP 404 for not found.

---

## 5. Definition of Done

### 5.1 Completion Criteria
- The home page must be accessible at the `/home` endpoint.
- The page must display correctly with the required styles.
- Performance must meet the loading time requirement.
- All acceptance criteria must be satisfied.

### 5.2 Test Coverage Requirements
- Achieve a minimum of 80% test coverage for any functions created in `main.py`.

### 5.3 Documentation Requirements
- Document the implementation in code comments.
- Update the README.md file to reflect the new home page feature.

## Critical Guidelines for Coding Agents

### ⚠️ BEFORE Writing Any Code

1. **Search Existing Codebase**
   - Check the project repository for similar functionality
   - Use grep/search to find existing utilities and helpers
   - DO NOT duplicate code that already exists

2. **Check Existing Libraries**
   - Review `requirements.txt` for available libraries
   - DO NOT install libraries that are already available
   - Justify any new library additions

### 🎯 Code Quality Standards

**Python Style (PEP 8)**:
- 100 character line limit
- snake_case for functions/variables
- PascalCase for classes
- Type hints for ALL parameters and returns
- Google-style docstrings for all functions/classes
- Meaningful variable names (no single letters except loop counters)

**API Design (RESTful)**:
- Resource-based URLs (nouns, not verbs): `/api/users` not `/api/getUsers`
- Standard HTTP methods: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (delete)
- Standard status codes: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error)
- Consistent error format: `{"error": {"code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Description"}}`
- JSON responses for all endpoints

**Testing Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- AAA pattern: Arrange (setup), Act (execute), Assert (verify)
- Test file naming: `test_<module_name>.py`
- Test function naming: `test_<function>_<scenario>_<expected_result>()`
- Test happy path, error cases, edge cases, and boundary conditions

**Security Requirements**:
- Validate ALL user input (type, format, range, length)
- Use parameterized queries for database operations (NEVER string concatenation)
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS
- Store secrets in environment variables (NEVER hardcode)
- Use HTTPS for external communications
- Implement rate limiting for public APIs
- Log security events (failed auth, suspicious activity)

**Error Handling**:
- Use specific exceptions (ValueError, TypeError, etc.) not bare `except:`
- Log errors with context using the logging module
- Return user-friendly error messages (don't leak internal details)
- Handle errors at appropriate levels (don't let them bubble to root)

**Documentation**:
- Module-level docstring explaining purpose
- Class docstrings with attributes and examples
- Function docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises sections
- Inline comments for complex logic (explain WHY, not WHAT)
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md
